# Project Roadmap

## Overview
This project will be planned phase-by-phase.
Run `project-architect-supervisor` to plan Phase 1 when ready.

## Phases

| Phase | Name | Status | Tasks |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | TBD | Pending | - |
| 2 | TBD | Pending | - |
| 3 | TBD | Pending | - |

## Current: Phase 1

*Phase 1 tasks will be added by project-architect-supervisor when you plan the first phase.*

<!--
IMPORTANT: This ROADMAP follows a phase-by-phase planning approach.
- Do NOT plan all phases upfront
- Run project-architect-supervisor to plan ONE phase at a time
- When a phase completes, the system will automatically prompt to plan the next phase

Task Status Markers:
- `[ ]` - Pending
- `[>]` - In Progress
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[!]` - Blocked (requires intervention; blocks overall completion)
- `[-]` - Skipped (explicitly skipped; does not block overall completion)
-->
